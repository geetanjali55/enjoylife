            <h3>10 Tips for healthy food</h3>
            <p>Prioritize Whole Foods: Focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.
                Portion Control: Be mindful of serving sizes to avoid overeating.
                Hydrate: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support bodily functions.
                Balance Macronutrients: Aim for a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in each meal to maintain energy levels and promote satiety.
                Limit Processed Foods: Minimize intake of processed and packaged foods high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and preservatives.
                Include Fiber: Incorporate fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes to support digestion and keep you feeling full.
                Choose Healthy Cooking Methods: Opt for baking, grilling, steaming, or saut√©ing over frying to reduce added fats and calories.
                Be Mindful of Salt Intake: Limit sodium intake by using herbs, spices, and citrus juices to flavor meals instead of salt.
                Plan Ahead: Meal prep and plan your meals and snacks in advance to avoid relying on unhealthy options when hunger strikes.
                Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues, and eat when you're hungry, stopping when you're satisfied.
